# SQL query to pandas statement

The SQL to Pandas Converter project offers a seamless solution for converting SQL queries into equivalent Pandas statements, leveraging the simplicity of Streamlit and the advanced capabilities of OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo. This innovative platform simplifies the transition from SQL-based data manipulation to Pandas DataFrame operations, facilitating efficient data analysis and manipulation workflows.

Key Components:

Streamlit Web Application: The project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive web-based interface for users to input SQL queries and visualize the corresponding Pandas statements. Streamlit's user-friendly design enables developers and data analysts to easily interact with the converter tool, streamlining the conversion process.

OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for Natural Language Understanding: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, an advanced language model, powers the natural language understanding component of the project. Trained on a vast corpus of text data, GPT-3.5 Turbo excels at comprehending user queries and generating contextually relevant responses. In this project, GPT-3.5 Turbo interprets SQL queries and formulates equivalent Pandas statements, simplifying the conversion process for users.

Workflow:

User Input of SQL Queries: Users input SQL queries into the Streamlit interface, specifying the desired data manipulation operations.

Natural Language Understanding with GPT-3.5 Turbo: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo processes the user's SQL query input, interpreting the natural language text and understanding the intended data manipulation tasks.

Conversion to Pandas Statements: Based on the interpreted SQL query, GPT-3.5 Turbo generates equivalent Pandas statements. These statements represent the corresponding data manipulation operations in the Pandas library, facilitating seamless translation from SQL to Pandas DataFrame operations.

Output Visualization: The converted Pandas statements are presented to the user through the Streamlit interface, allowing users to review and copy the generated code for further use in their data analysis projects.

The SQL to Pandas Converter project harnesses the power of Streamlit and OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo to offer a user-friendly and efficient solution for converting SQL queries into Pandas statements. By simplifying the transition between SQL and Pandas data manipulation, this project empowers data analysts and developers to streamline their data analysis workflows and unlock new insights from their datasets with ease.
